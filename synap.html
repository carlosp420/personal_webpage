<p>1 == (Ehrlich, 1958) female forelegs modified, the tarsus often having less than five segments and usually lacking pretarsal claws; leg not used for walking, but Paralethe and Atirrhea, Amnosia and Stibochiona have claws on the foreleg! (in Ackery et al 1999).

<p>2 == (DeVries et al 1985) three larval characters: (1) Post-occiput of larva with well-sclerotized margins. (2) Ovoid muscle scar mesad of lateral spine plate. (3) Wart-like pinacula restricted to the epiproct.

<p>3 == hemispherical eggs, male abdominal hairbrushes, anal plates of the female gentialia

<p>4 == (Ehrlich 1958) male genitalia: presence of a superuncus, absence of gnathos; <br> Thorax clothed in golden, organe of red hairs;<br>  Antennae naked, with two circular shallow depresions between the carinae on every flagellar segments.

<p>5 == (1) Parapatagia partly or entirely sclerotized (Ehrlich 1958). (2) Forewing veins Rs3 and Rs4 shortly stalked (Rydon 1971).
<p>6  == Freitas &amp; Brown, 2004: 96(1) Last instar larva-Filiform setae on 3A and 8A: absent.
<p>7  == Freitas &amp; Brown, 2004: 59(1) Last instar larva-Body covered by abundant soft hairs: present.
<p>8  == Freitas &amp; Brown, 2004: 12(1) Egg apex concave
<p>9  == Freitas &amp; Brown, 2004: 163(1) Parapatagium present
<p>10 == Freitas &amp; Brown, 2004: 151(1) Precostal cell: present

<p>Freitas &amp; Brown, 2004:
In figure 2, successive weighting of the whole dataset recovers Calinaga sister to the "satyrine clade": Charaxinae, Satyrinae, Morphini + Brassolini (Morphinae) appear as monophyletic entities. But! there was only Taenaris (Amathussini) in the sampling!.

<b>SATYRINAE</b><br>
Scott &amp; Wright, 1990<br>
-Hypopteron shrank on adult mesothorax<br>
-Anepisternum shrank on adult mesothorax<br>
-Third larval eye doubled in size<br>
-First larval eye usually vestigial.<br>
-First stage larva head has seta PA1 (=P1) nearly as dorsal as seta PA2 (=P2).<br>
-First stage larva has a secondary seta (P2.2) on A10 proleg.<br>
-Forewing veins swollen at base. This is a weak trait because several forewings are enlarged at base in all butterflies, though not usually as large<br>
-Miller (1968) says Cercyonis first stage larvae have two SD setae on meso- and metathorax as do other Satyrinae and most Nymphalidae, contrary to Scott 1985.<br>

1) brown colored wings on both surfaces; lack of markings on upperside surfaces (with exception of a diffuse dark brown line on the margin of FW upperside.  <br>
2) relatively thin dark brown discal, postdiscal and marginal lines on underside wing surfaces as opposed to P. albinotata  <br>
3) rather simple ocelli on underside wing surfaces, consisting of a light colored (white or yellowish) dot always present, encircled by up to three concentric rings of different colors, never two light color dots as pupils,as in Megeuptychia antonoe.<br>
