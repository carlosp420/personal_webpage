Fredy Montero was very kind to send me his recent publication (with Maira Ortiz)
describing morphological characters of eggs, larvae and pupae of  the satyrine
butterfly genus *Junea*.

They raised the specimens on the hostplant *Chusquea* in Colombia. What I found
most interesting is the morphology of the last instars of the larva. They have
very long "horns" and long bifid "tails".

It was believed that the only Neotropical butterfly with these traits was the 
satyrine butterfly *Eteona tisiphone* from southeast Brazil:

These similarities explain in part why *Eteona* and *Junea* appear as closely
related taxa in the Satyrinae phylogeny that we published in 2006:

At the time of writing that manuscript, it was very strange to find the Andean
genera *Junea* and Pronophila close to the genera *Eteona* and *Foetterleia* 
(that are mainly distributed in Southeastern Brazil, Paraguay and northern 
Argentina). It is nice to see that these relationships can be supported by 
morphological characters of immature stages. It would be very interesting to see
whether the larvae and pupae of Pronophila and *Foetterleia* share the same 
characters with *Eteona* and *Junea*. This could require interesting 
biogeographical explanations for such close relationships of among currently disjunct taxa.
