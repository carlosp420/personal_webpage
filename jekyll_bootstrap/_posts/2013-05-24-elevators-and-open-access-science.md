[Kone](http://www.kone.com/countries/fi_FI/Pages/default.aspx) is a Finnish 
company **dedicated to people flow** (it makes escalators, elevators and other
machinery). But Kone also has a foundation that finance research in Science, 
Humanities and Art, Kone foundation (or [Koneen Säätiö](http://www.koneensaatio.fi/en/)).

I really like Koneen Säätiö because my salary as postdoctoral researcher in the
laboratory of Genetics at the University of Turku is paid through a grant they
gave to [Niklas Wahlberg](http://nymphalidae.utu.fi/Wahlberg.htm).

I like it more now because they started to support the Open Access movement in
scientific publishing. They sent an email to grant holders a couple of days ago
saying the following:

> Koneen Säätiö suosittelee tutkijoilleen tieteellisten julkaisujen avointa
> saatavuutta

Which means, more or less, that "**the Kone foundation recommends that scientist
should publish open access papers**".

This is a Google Translation from the rest of the recommendation:

Well, it is good that the local <strike>company making elevators</strike> funding
agency is pushing scientists to publish their output in Open Access venues.

Kalle Korhonen from the Kone foundation commented that they are now an independent 
entity of the elevator company Kone.
