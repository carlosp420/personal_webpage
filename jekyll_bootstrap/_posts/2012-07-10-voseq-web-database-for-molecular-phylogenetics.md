* Are you working in molecular phylogenetics? Do you and your lab produce lots of DNA sequences. 
* Are you tired of trying to find your sequences among several text files and Excel sheets? 
* Do you wish there was a easy-to-use database to keep track of sequences and their associated voucher specimens? 
* Did you ever wished there was a system to create molecular datasets for analysis in PAUP or MrBayes by just a few clicks of a mouse? 

If the answers are *yes*, then **VoSeq** might be for you. **VoSeq** is a voucher and DNA
sequence web application database aimed for people working in molecular phylogenetics.

Main features of **VoSeq**:

* Keep track of your sequences and associated voucher specimens. 
* You upload your data to VoSeq and the back-end relational database will allow you to easily search, fetch, update, etc your DNA sequences or voucher data. 
* With a few clicks, you can create ready-to-run datasets in NEXUS, Phylip, TNT formats, as well as FASTA files for submission to GenBank. 
* Use the BLAST capabilities to find similar sequences among those you have, or BLAST against GenBank. 
* Automated integration with public web services such as Flickr (for posting your voucher photos) and Yahoo Maps (for plotting voucher localities). 
* You can install it in your computer for private use, or set it up in a shared server for collaborative work via the internet. 
* and more. 

The publication describing VoSeq came out recently:
